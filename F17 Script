#Okay, let's try this from https://www.r-bloggers.com/principal-component-analysis-in-r/

#S17 Spreadsheet is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GFw004SI96wYMcSsDMXtUinV_jSlt4OEUZtIYFgNdw/edit#gid=693934932

#First let's set the WD, and find the file we want
getwd ()
setwd("/Users/mintwealth/documents/S5/4990")
getwd()
dir()

#Now let's put in the CSV sheet
Skull=read.csv("F17maybe.csv")
attach(Skull)
View(Skull)

#This time, we'll try the "prcomp()" function
#I learned over the summer that settinge everything to "numeric" doesn't work as it seems.
#We'll instead just choose the portion of the dataframe that is numeric

SkullPCA=prcomp(Skull[1:141,2:43])

#Now we'll plot the first two columns of "SkullPCA," as those are the first 2 PC's.
plot(SkullPCA$x[,1:2], pch=21, cex=2, col="black", bg=as.character(Skull[,44]), main = "Matthew's F17 Graph")
with(SkullPCA, text(SkullPCA$x[,1:2], labels = row.names(Skull), cex = 0.5, pos = 1))

#Now let's plot loadings
#We need these things first.
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("pcaMethods")
library(pcaMethods)

#Now we can plot
SkullPCAmethods <- pca(Skull[1:141,2:43], scale = "uv", center = T, nPcs = 2, method = "svd")
slplot(SkullPCAmethods, scoresLoadings = c(F,T), lcex=0.6)
#The function can plot scores (PC's), next to loadings, but that doesn't work, so I set scores to F.

#I still don't know how to standardize size, so we can compare just shape differences.

#So for now, let's just try omitting the dark green washingtons, to see what we get.
WSkullPCA=prcomp(Skull[1:127,2:43])
WSkullPCA$x[,1:2]

plot(WSkullPCA$x[,1:2], pch=21, cex=2, col="black", bg=as.character(Skull[,44]), main = "Matthew's F17 Graph Without Washington")
